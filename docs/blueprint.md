# **App Name**: LKR Grid Save

## Core Features:

- Account Management: Create, rename, delete, and switch between multiple saving accounts.
- Savings Plan Setup: Set a goal amount and choose the plan duration (30, 365, or custom days).
- Savings Intensity Recommendation: Based on a savings intensity (1-10) that the user selects, get AI-powered recommendations of how much the user should set aside on a daily basis. LLM acts as a tool by estimating reasonable amounts based on a calculation combining target, risk tolerance (saving intensity rating) and timeline.
- Manual Extra Savings: Add any amount on any day to adjust savings beyond the set plan.
- Progress Tracking: Mark each day's tile as saved, auto-updating overall progress.
- Dashboard Analytics: Display totals saved, remaining, and goal progress (%), with charts for monthly saving bars and a cumulative saving curve.
- Backup/Restore: Export/import your account or plan as a JSON backup.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong Violet (#9400D3) for a forward-looking sensibility, and clear differentiation from common associations of money with green. Not teal.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF) to offer contrast with a violet-centered pallette and give a light, clean, and calming atmosphere.
- Accent color: Electric ultramarine (#4166F5), slightly lighter, to highlight important CTAs.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Clean, grid-based layout with clear sections for accounts, plans, and analytics.
- Use simple, modern icons to represent account actions and progress metrics.
- Subtle animations to indicate savings progress and tile selection.
